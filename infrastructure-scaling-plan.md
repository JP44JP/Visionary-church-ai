CREATE SCHEMA tenant_2;
-- Shared tables in 'shared' schema
```

### Phase 2: Read Replicas
```
Primary DB (Write operations)
├── Read Replica 1 (Member queries)
├── Read Replica 2 (Event/Analytics queries)  
└── Read Replica 3 (Chat/Search queries)
```

### Phase 3: Horizontal Sharding
```
Shard 1: Tenants 1-1000
Shard 2: Tenants 1001-2000
Shard 3: Tenants 2001-3000
